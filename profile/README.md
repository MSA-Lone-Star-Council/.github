## ðŸš€ About
Launched in 2002, MSA Lone Star Council has connected MSAs to regional organizations and nationwide resources. Our platform allows MSAs to discuss solutions and exchange ideas in order for local organizations and its members to reach their highest potential. 

MSA Lone Star Council operates with the understanding that through cooperation we can achieve much more than we can accomplish individually.
