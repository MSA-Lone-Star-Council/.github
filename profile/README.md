The MSA Lone Star Council (LSC) is a student-led and operated 501(c)(3) charitable non-profit that focuses on supporting Muslim students in Texas by facilitating networking and training opportunities. We serve to unify MSAs across Texas and beyond. 


    
## ðŸš€ About
Launched in 2002, MSA Lone Star Council has connected MSAs to regional organizations and nationwide resources. Our platform allows MSAs to discuss solutions and exchange ideas in order for local MSA chapters and its members to reach their highest potential. 

The MSA Lone Star Council operates with the understanding that through cooperation, we can achieve much more than we can individually.
